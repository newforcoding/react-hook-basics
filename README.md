React team released a new addition, hooks, to React in version 16.8.0.
The reason of adding hook in react is to offer a more powerful and expressiv functionality between components. 

#useState - managing state in our functional components.
State is a set of values that controls the properties or behavior of a components.

#useEffect - It perform an action on every render or re-render.Change elements on the DOM and fetching data from an API.

#useRef - The useRef React hook is a function that returns a mutable ref object. Refs are a way to access DOM nodes in React.
Accessing DOM elements directly inside React.
Store state values that do not trigger re-renders and are persisted across re-renders.

#useMemo - Basically used for memoization of some expensive calculations.It is being used for performance optimization.

#useCallback - useCallback is also used for the memoization purpose but it will return the memoized function callback instead of some expensive calculation result.

#useFetch - Reusable custome hook which fetch the data.
